# ABOUT INTROSORT
Introsort also known as Introspective sort. Intrsort is a hybrid sorting algorithm which means that it combines two or more other algorithms that solve the same problem. This is generally done to combine wanted features of each, so that the overall algorithm is better than the individual components. Introsort is an unstable sorting algorithm. It is a comparision sort. It begins with quicksort and then switches to heapsort to avoid worst case performance of quicksort.

# WORKING
starts with quicksort

If the recursion depth gets too big, switch to heapsort

# TO DO STEPS
Just simply enter array size or total number of elements to be sorted (Random numbers are generated because random function library is used in code)

# OUTCOME
Total number of unsorted elements are entered by user and through Introsort algorithm user gets sorted array at the end.
